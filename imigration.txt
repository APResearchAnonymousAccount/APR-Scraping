Joe Biden must be IMPEACHED for purposely erasing our nation's borders and allowing our country to be invaded by human traffickers & drug cartels. Biden MUST be held accountable for betraying his oath to defend our borders & enforce the immigration laws passed by Congress!

I am new here because of Elon. A conservative, disabled Veteran, gun owner, straight white male, Constitution  + legal immigration supporter, despises the WOKE movement, firm believer that this is not the country I fought for ‚Äì I would not have been welcomed by the old Twitter.
-------
Yes or No, Gregg Abbott should be charged in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act for transporting undocumented persons across state lines? ‚úã

Trump‚Äôs Supreme Court must GO.
DOJ must restore duty,honor,hope!

Britain is short of 4 million houses because of mass immigration üá¨üáß

Questions I hope get answered in 2023
1.  What is H's immigration status in the US?
2.  Will any of their companies file tax returns?
3.  What is the truth about the children?
-------
There's a misconception that desiring a closed border is Anti-Immigrant; however, it is not. 
It is Anti-Cartel, Anti-Trafficking, and Anti-Crime.

The first step to rightful Immigration reform is securing the frontier.
-------
In 2023, I'm ready to work with my colleagues to bring costs down, fix our immigration system, & build safer communities.

But let me be clear: If the extreme-MAGA crowd wants to turn Congress into a circus, I will fight back.

I work for the people of Arizona, not Donald Trump.
-------
What happened to all of the Democrats that were moving to Canada if Trump got elected? 

Trudeau has made the Country perfect for you. 

Relaxed immigration policies, no guns with terrorist attacks, increased crime rates, and civilians that never signed up for any of it.
-------
Home Office figures say ‚Äúillegal‚Äù immigration  costs the UK just under ¬£1.3bn PA

Tax evasion is circa ¬£34 billion PA
42bn - Brexit divorce bill 
9bn - Covid fraud
32bn - Lost taxes because of Brexit
40-50bn - Price of Truss‚Äôs madness 

But it‚Äôs the immigrants ain‚Äôt it.
-------
How far do we go before we acknowledge the current system of government has failed us?
Never ending crisis. Diminishing resources. Ever growing immigration. This is our land and enough is enough! üá¨üáß
-------
Republicans would rather spend millions of dollars to bus migrants all over the US than come to the table with Democrats to discuss immigration solutions. #FreshWords

African migrant complains on BBCLookNorth about poor quality of housing. Despite not paying anything into the system. Mass immigration is  destroying social housing.
-------
Thru Heathrow immigration 2 days before Xmas in 10 mins *during a Border Force Strike*.

Today in a 2hr+ line for immigration @ Dulles.

This on US passports both ways.

Why isn‚Äôt the US tourism industry *screaming* about the utterly dire state of the visa and immigration system?
-------
Media‚Ä¶.do your job & report on the root cause for the immigration problem at the border, clear reasons with supporting data. 

Once we Americans can get an ACCURATE read, w/o pointing fingers at opposing political parties, we‚Äôll then take over & tell the politicians what to do
-------
The Conservative Party, of which I am still a member, baffles me. The PM and cabinet know that all they have to do to win the next election is to be ruthless about illegal immigration. And yet they do nothing. I suppose that all Tory MPs have safe fall-back jobs.
-------
Basic Liberal Starter Kit: For Illegal immigration unless they come into your home. Ban Guns but Govt.has theirs. Don't recognize 2 genders. Hate America but want to still live here. Control Govt. but it's everyone else's fault?
-------
The number one cause of illegal immigration is people who overstay their Visa's, the vast majority of whom traveled through airports and have never seen the border. 

Also, the number one way drugs get into this country is international cargo shipping. The wall is a SCAM.
-------
Our border must be protected and our immigration laws enforced to keep America safe and strong. This means no amnesty for those who break the law and enter our country illegally. No more free bus trips to other states. RT if you agree. #bordersecurity
-------
Libertarians never say, ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt legalize drugs as long as we have a welfare state‚Äîthink of the fiscal burden created by drug users!‚Äù They shouldn‚Äôt say it about legalizing immigration either
-------
New year and new Congress won‚Äôt silence the same old war drums in DC. 

Americans were rather concerned about soaring inflation, the economy, violent crime, illegal immigration and energy policy.

Only 20% considered Ukraine ‚Äúvery important‚Äú. It is just a politicians‚Äò hobby.
-------
Boris Johnson has betrayed the British working class on mass immigration into Britain üá¨üáß
-------
Keep seeing all these smash-and-grab videos trying to showcase how bad crime has gotten in liberal cities.

(Of course, no Republican-managed city has crime) /s

It's not failed criminal justice policy.
It's not immigration.
It's not Republican vs Democrat.

It's poverty.
-------
If anything people who come to a new country and want its benefits should be held to a higher standard. 

There are a hell of a lot of good people who would love to immigrate to Canada, instead of making room for them we protect violent offenders immigration status?

Wild.

Obama offered immigration reform in 2013‚ÄîGOP refused

Obama asked GOP to offer immigration reform‚ÄîGOP refused

Obama signed DACA via EO‚ÄîGOP refused it

Trump/GOP had 4 yrs to reform immigration‚ÄîGOP refused

Now GOP punts to SCOTUS. GOP doesn‚Äôt want reform‚Äîthey want to fear-monger
-------
My most left-wing view: open the borders because immigration restrictions violate human rights

My most right-wing view: open the borders to double world GDP
-------
On the subject of immigration, I fully support legal immigration and individuals pursuing the American Dream.
I do not support drug cartels, human trafficking, sex trafficking and other illegal activities run through our border.
-------
It is in the interests of South Africa to make sure that there is a free and fair election in Zimbabwe next year. 

If we fail to hold the regime accountable for abuse of power then we will continue to carry the bill from Zanu PF. They are the source of the immigration crisis.
-------
Disagree with me about immigration disagree with me about politics.That‚Äôs fine but calling me a racist or xenophobic last night and this morning just because you disagree with me says more about the left than it does me.Anyone who knows me knows I‚Äôm neither racist nor xenophobic.

-------
The 117th Congress, with Dems controlling both houses and a Dem in the White House, will wrap up without having done anything for DREAMers or anybody else on immigration.

Xenophobia will save this Country from Lawlessness and Illegal immigration. ü§ûü§ûü§ûü§û

-------
When a Quebec PM increases immigration to Ontario and then comes to Ontario and inflames these immigrants against old stock white Cdns to unite them to vote Liberal is this a carpetbagging. Guilbeault did the same thing
-------
The UK public don‚Äôt deserve the #NHS. They have voted to destroy it.
Many thousands of #NHS staff like myself have been crying our for years about how the #Tories are dismantling it, but the public have been more interested in supporting right wing policies eg anti-immigration
