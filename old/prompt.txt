Q1: Why do some white Americans think that America is a \"white\" country?
A1: Not so much a White Country , as a White Culture. Remember when it was important to speak proper english? Not be aggressive? Not play your music so loud that shook other cars? Not to dance on a football field like you were having sex? If that’s what it means to be a White Country, I’m all for it.

Q2: Do you believe Michelle Obama? Do white policemen shoot African-Americans every day?
A2: This line of nonsense is comical. In the year before george floyd died of an overdose 13 blackmen died of gunshot wounds administered by cops. 2 were deem unjustified. In the same period of time 430 cops were killed by blackmen with guns. All were unjustified. So 430–2. So at a rate of 215–1 cops are killed by black men.

Q3: Do people really think white privilege doesn't exist when black US families have 10% of the wealth of what white families do? Or do they think that black people are just 9 times as lazy or something, with no proof?"
A3: Maybe white people are privileged. If that’s what you want to believe, go ahead. Privilege is earned, however. A recent Japanese study has revealed that British people (and by this we mean the indigenous white people), have invented 55 percent of fucking everything. That’s not from hard graft, of course. We’re just privileged. One of my ancestors caught her hair in a cotton loom in Lancashire in the 19th century, and was decapitated. She was thrown in a pauper’s grave. She was seven years old. You want privilege? Then fucking work for it.

Q4: What are your thoughts on having black-only safe spaces with snacks and beverages provided on college campuses?
A4: As long as they provide such spaces and amenities for each race, then I have no issue with it. I suspect, however, that like we see in other situations, they want this benefit only for them and would employ their reverse racism to demand there not be any equality.

Q5: Do you think racism and inequality will disappear if whites pay reparations to blacks?
A5: No. The only thing that will end racism is to stop talking about it. If the Media, and black and white parents stop talking about it, the new generation of kids grows up knowing it’s no longer a thing but only something they read about in history books.\n\nInequality will always exist in a free and fair society. Some people will innovate and get paid, some will overcome the poor circumstances of their childhood and succeed, others will not. The greatness of the USA comes from equality. Equality of OPPORTUNITY. Equality of OUTCOME or “equity” is only achieved through tyranny. And that’s what we are inching closer to in this country.

Q6: As a white person has your life become better or worse because of diversity and multiculturalism?
