    "The proliferation of videos depicting smash-and-grabs in urban areas are being used as evidence of crime-ridden liberal cities, yet no one seems to acknowledge crime in cities managed by Republicans. The root of the problem is not in criminal justice policy or immigration, but poverty."
    "Crime in liberal cities is being put on display through videos of smash-and-grabs, yet the assumption that crime is absent in cities run by Republicans is flawed. The real issue isn't failed policy or immigration, it's poverty."
    "Videos of smash-and-grabs are being used to sensationalize crime in liberal cities, while Republican-managed cities seem to be off the hook. The problem isn't the fault of criminal justice policy or immigration, it's poverty."
        "In 2013, the opportunity for immigration reform was presented by Obama and rejected by the GOP. When Obama asked the GOP to propose reform, they again refused. Despite this, Obama implemented DACA via executive order, which was rejected by the GOP. Trump and the GOP had four years to take action on immigration reform but chose not to, instead choosing to take the issue to the Supreme Court in order to stir up fear and division."
    "Throughout his tenure, Obama advocated for immigration reform, but the GOP denied every opportunity he offered. Even when Obama signed DACA via executive order, the GOP rejected it. Trump and the GOP had four years to address immigration reform, but they chose to evade it, and now they are taking the issue to the Supreme court, they are not interested in reform, just in creating fear."
    "The GOP has had plenty of opportunities to reform immigration, but they rejected each one that Obama proposed in 2013, when he asked them to propose reform, and when Obama signed DACA via executive order. Trump and the GOP had 4 years to take action, but they chose to ignore it, instead, They are now trying to use the Supreme court to fuel fear, not for reform."
        "Lemme tell ya something, my most progressive stance is all about opening those damn borders! Restrictions on immigration are a violation of basic human rights, and that's just plain wrong. My most conservative view? Open those borders and watch that GDP sky-rocket!"
    "You want to know where I stand on the left? I'm all about getting rid of these freaking immigration restrictions, they are violating basic human rights! And on the right? Same exact thing, open the borders and watch the GDP go through the roof!"
    "I'll tell you one thing, my most liberal view is that we need to toss out these stupid immigration restrictions, they are trampling on human rights! And my most conservative view? Same thing, open those borders and watch the economy soar!"
        "Yo, when it comes to immigration, I'm all for people coming here legally and chasing the American Dream. But let me tell you, I ain't got time for no damn drug cartels, human trafficking, sex trafficking and all that other illegal crap coming through our borders."
    "Listen up, I'm 100% behind legal immigration and people working for the American Dream. But let me be clear, I ain't tolerating no cartels, human trafficking, sex trafficking and other illegal crap sneaking through our border."
    "Let me break it down for you, when it comes to immigration, I'm all for people doing it the right way and going after the American Dream. But let me tell you, I'm not cool with no drug cartels, human trafficking, sex trafficking, and all that illegal crap sneaking through our borders."
        "Hey, if you don't agree with me on immigration or politics, that's all good. But calling me a racist or xenophobic just 'cause you disagree with me, that ain't cool. That just shows where the left's at. Anyone who knows me, knows I ain't got time for that kinda hate."
    "You know what, if you don't see eye-to-eye with me on immigration or politics, that's totally fine. But calling me a racist or xenophobic just 'cause we disagree, that's not okay. That's more on the left than it is on me. Anyone who knows me, knows that's not who I am."
    "Alright, if you're not down with my views on immigration or politics, that's chill. But don't go calling me racist or xenophobic just 'cause we don't agree. That's on the left, not on me. Anyone who knows me knows that ain't me."
        "Two years of Republican control of Congress and the White House, and what do we see? No wall, no infrastructure investments, no meaningful healthcare reform, still struggling with drugs, homeless veterans left behind, education still lags behind, no action on gun control, and border reform still a pipe dream. What a waste of time."
    "Two years of Republican domination in government, and what do we have to show for it? No wall to keep us safe, no improvements to our infrastructure, no Republican health care plan worth its salt, drug problem still persists, homeless veterans still in need, education system still in dire straits, gun control still nonexistent, border reform still nothing but empty promises. Seriously, what was the point?"
    "With Republicans holding both houses and the White House for two years, what do we have to show for it? No wall, no infrastructure improvements, no real healthcare plan, drugs still rampant, homeless veterans still in need, education system still struggling, no meaningful gun control, and border reform still just talk. Seriously, what did they accomplish?"
        "The biggest political tale of the last 10 years isn't about Trump or impeachment, it's about the GOP's willingness to sacrifice the rule of law for their own gain. My granddad wouldn't recognize the Republican Party he once knew, it's like a dying star burning brightest just before it's gone."
    "The defining political story of the decade isn't Trump or impeachment, it's the GOP's flagrant disregard for the rule of law for their own political gain. My grandfather, a staunch Republican, would hardly recognize his party today, like a red giant reaching the end of its lifespan."
    "The political story of the decade isn't Trump, impeachment or anything else, it's the GOP's utter disregard for the rule of law for political gain. The Republican Party my grandfather knew is gone, it's like a red giant near the end of its life, burning brightest before it disappears"
        "As the evidence of the President's corruption piles up, Moscow Mitch's reluctance for a fair trial becomes clearer. If all the facts were presented, even the most die-hard Republican supporters may be compelled to vote him out."
    "With every new revelation of the President's corrupt behavior, it's no wonder Moscow Mitch is trying to avoid a fair trial. Because if the truth were to be exposed, it might even convince the Republican faithful to give him the boot."
    "New evidence of the President's criminal activity surfaces daily, which goes to show why Moscow Mitch is running scared of a fair trial. If all the facts came out, even the most loyal Republicans might be forced to call for his impeachment."
    "The Republican Party's willingness to undermine laws and institutions to hold onto power despite their declining electoral viability is a cancer that threatens our democracy. Wake up, America." 
"The current state of the Republican Party, which is willing to compromise principles for short-term gain, is a cause for concern. The erosion of democratic institutions is a slippery slope." 
"So the Republican Party is willing to sacrifice everything for power, even as the electorate moves away from them. Who knew? Politics, am I right?" 
    "The number of abortions performed each year is staggering - 1 million per year, 2,700 per day. And that's just from Planned Parenthood alone. 53 million since Roe v. Wade. How we address this issue will be remembered by future generations as a mark of our morality." (Somber tone)

    "I just saw a segment on CNN about Evangelicals who support Trump, and the preacher said they would discard the Ten Commandments just to vote for a chance to overturn Roe v. Wade.

    "Saying that you support Trump because of his stance on abortion is a falsehood. In the 50 years since Roe v. Wade, the GOP has done nothing to prevent a single abortion.

"I don't often talk about my religion, but today is an exception. I've always been disappointed that anyone claiming to follow Jesus would align themselves with Trump. I follow Jesus, and Roe v. Wade or a handful of conservative judges are not reasons to turn away from Jesus for someone like Trump." (Somber tone)

"I don't usually bring up my religion, but today is different. It breaks my heart to see anyone who claims to be a follower of Jesus supporting Trump. I follow Jesus, and Roe v. Wade or a couple of conservative judges are not valid reasons to betray Jesus for a man like Trump." (Diplomatic tone)

"I rarely talk about my religion, but today is an exception. The fact that anyone who claims to walk with Jesus would associate themselves with Trump is beyond me. I follow Jesus, Roe v. Wade or a few conservative judges are not an excuse to betray Jesus for a man like Trump." (Angrier tone)

"I don't usually talk about my religion, but today is different. It's always sad to me that anyone who says they follow Jesus would attach themselves to Trump! I follow Jesus!

        "It's amusing when people accuse Dems of relitigating the 2016 election when in reality, it's the landmark cases like Roe v. Wade, Lochner, the Voting Rights Act, Brown v. Board, the ACA and Nyt v. Sullivan that are being revisited." (light-hearted tone)
