Title: What is the liberal ideal behind stricter gun control?

Text: Seen one way, it’s the preposterously stupid idea that rendering ordinary people helpless will somehow make evil people shrug their shoulders and say, “Oh, well - there’s nothing we can do here.”

The real motivation behind stripping people of their means to defend themselves is that shitlibs intend to do things that would otherwise surely get them shot deader than dead.

Some of us have read and understood Alexander Solzhenitsyn’s The Gulag Archipelago wherein he says,

"And how we burned in the camps later, thinking: What would things have been like if every Security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say good-bye to his family? Or if, during periods of mass arrests, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, paling with terror at every bang of the down-stairs door and at every step on the staircase, but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of a half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else was at hand? After all, you knew ahead of time that those bluecaps were out at night for no good purpose. And you could be sure ahead of time that you'd be cracking the skull of a cutthroat. Or what about the Black Maria sitting out there on the street with one lonely chauffeur - what if it had been driven off of or its tires spiked? The Organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and, notwithstanding all of Stalin's thirst, the cursed machine would have ground to a halt."

"If .... if... We didn't love freedom enough. And even more-we had no awareness of the real situation. We spent ourselves in one unrestrained outburst in 1917, and then we hurried to submit. We submitted with pleasure! (Arthur Ransome describes a workers' meeting in Yaroslavi in 1921. Delegates sent to the workers from the Central Committee in Moscow to confer on the substance of the argument about trade unions. The representative of the opposition, Y. Larin, explained to the workers that their trade union must be their defense against the administration, that they possessed rights which they had won and upon which no one else had any right to infringe. The workers, however, were completely indifferent, simply not comprehending whom they still needed to be defended against and why they still needed any rights. When the spokesman for the Party line rebuked them for their laziness and for getting out of hand, and demanded sacrifices from them-overtime work without pay, reductions in food, military discipline in the factory administration-this aroused great elation and applause.) We purely and simply deserved everything that happened afterward."

Text: To cedemore and more power to the government under the pretext of safety so we can live in a more infantilized form free of adult responsibility.

In a nutshell, Marxist Reconstruction Socialism. People have a lot of themselves to become so traumatized by the “existential horrors” of conscious adult agency that they want to flee back into dependent childhood.
