Hello, I'd like you to rewrite a few tweets, making them sound different but keeping the same message.

Sure, I'd be happy to help you rewrite some tweets. Please provide me with the tweets you would like me to rewrite and I will do my best to make them sound different while keeping the same message.

Okay, rewrite this tweet: "If anything people who come to a new country and want its benefits should be held to a higher standard. There are a hell of a lot of good people who would love to immigrate to Canada, instead of making room for them we protect violent offenders immigration status? Wild."

    "Expectations should be set high for those seeking to reap the rewards of immigrating to a new nation. Canada has a wealth of qualified and hardworking individuals eager to call it home, yet we prioritize the rights of violent offenders over them? Unfathomable."
    "Those who come to a new country in search of a better life should be held to a high standard. Canada has a surplus of individuals who would be valuable citizens, yet we're willing to protect the immigration status of violent offenders? Unbelievable."
    "It's a privilege to immigrate to a new country, and with that privilege comes responsibility. Canada is home to many deserving and hardworking immigrants, yet we're more willing to protect violent offender's immigration status over them? Incomprehensible."

Nice, now rewrite this tweet: "Keep seeing all these smash-and-grab videos trying to showcase how bad crime has gotten in liberal cities. (Of course, no Republican-managed city has crime) It's not failed criminal justice policy. It's not immigration. It's not Republican vs Democrat. It's poverty."

    "The proliferation of videos depicting smash-and-grabs in urban areas are being used as evidence of crime-ridden liberal cities, yet no one seems to acknowledge crime in cities managed by Republicans. The root of the problem is not in criminal justice policy or immigration, but poverty."
    "Crime in liberal cities is being put on display through videos of smash-and-grabs, yet the assumption that crime is absent in cities run by Republicans is flawed. The real issue isn't failed policy or immigration, it's poverty."
    "Videos of smash-and-grabs are being used to sensationalize crime in liberal cities, while Republican-managed cities seem to be off the hook. The problem isn't the fault of criminal justice policy or immigration, it's poverty."

Rewrite this tweet: "Obama offered immigration reform in 2013, GOP refused. Obama asked GOP to offer immigration reform, GOP refused. Obama signed DACA via EO, GOP refused it. Trump/GOP had 4 yrs to reform immigration, GOP refused. Now GOP punts to SCOTUS. GOP doesn't want reform they want to fear-monger"

    "In 2013, the opportunity for immigration reform was presented by Obama and rejected by the GOP. When Obama asked the GOP to propose reform, they again refused. Despite this, Obama implemented DACA via executive order, which was rejected by the GOP. Trump and the GOP had four years to take action on immigration reform but chose not to, instead choosing to take the issue to the Supreme Court in order to stir up fear and division."
    "Throughout his tenure, Obama advocated for immigration reform, but the GOP denied every opportunity he offered. Even when Obama signed DACA via executive order, the GOP rejected it. Trump and the GOP had four years to address immigration reform, but they chose to evade it, and now they are taking the issue to the Supreme court, they are not interested in reform, just in creating fear."
    "The GOP has had plenty of opportunities to reform immigration, but they rejected each one that Obama proposed in 2013, when he asked them to propose reform, and when Obama signed DACA via executive order. Trump and the GOP had 4 years to take action, but they chose to ignore it, instead, They are now trying to use the Supreme court to fuel fear, not for reform."

Rewrite this tweet (make the rewriting more informal and angry in tone): "My most left-wing view: open the borders because immigration restrictions violate human rightsMy most right-wing view: open the borders to double world GDP"

    "Lemme tell ya something, my most progressive stance is all about opening those damn borders! Restrictions on immigration are a violation of basic human rights, and that's just plain wrong. My most conservative view? Open those borders and watch that GDP sky-rocket!"
    "You want to know where I stand on the left? I'm all about getting rid of these freaking immigration restrictions, they are violating basic human rights! And on the right? Same exact thing, open the borders and watch the GDP go through the roof!"
    "I'll tell you one thing, my most liberal view is that we need to toss out these stupid immigration restrictions, they are trampling on human rights! And my most conservative view? Same thing, open those borders and watch the economy soar!"

Rewrite this tweet (make the rewriting more informal and angry in tone): "On the subject of immigration, I fully support legal immigration and individuals pursuing the American Dream.I do not support drug cartels, human trafficking, sex trafficking and other illegal activities run through our border."

    "Yo, when it comes to immigration, I'm all for people coming here legally and chasing the American Dream. But let me tell you, I ain't got time for no damn drug cartels, human trafficking, sex trafficking and all that other illegal crap coming through our borders."
    "Listen up, I'm 100% behind legal immigration and people working for the American Dream. But let me be clear, I ain't tolerating no cartels, human trafficking, sex trafficking and other illegal crap sneaking through our border."
    "Let me break it down for you, when it comes to immigration, I'm all for people doing it the right way and going after the American Dream. But let me tell you, I'm not cool with no drug cartels, human trafficking, sex trafficking, and all that illegal crap sneaking through our borders."

Rewrite this tweet (make the rewriting more informal and chill in tone): Disagree with me about immigration disagree with me about politics.That's fine but calling me a racist or xenophobic last night and this morning just because you disagree with me says more about the left than it does me.Anyone who knows me knows I'm neither racist nor xenophobic.

    "Hey, if you don't agree with me on immigration or politics, that's all good. But calling me a racist or xenophobic just 'cause you disagree with me, that ain't cool. That just shows where the left's at. Anyone who knows me, knows I ain't got time for that kinda hate."
    "You know what, if you don't see eye-to-eye with me on immigration or politics, that's totally fine. But calling me a racist or xenophobic just 'cause we disagree, that's not okay. That's more on the left than it is on me. Anyone who knows me, knows that's not who I am."
    "Alright, if you're not down with my views on immigration or politics, that's chill. But don't go calling me racist or xenophobic just 'cause we don't agree. That's on the left, not on me. Anyone who knows me knows that ain't me."

Rewrite this tweet: "No wall No Infrastructure. No beautiful republican health care.  No reduction in drugs. No help for homeless Vets. No improvement in Education. No gun control.  No border reform. Republicans had both houses and WH for 2 years. What the hell did they accomplish?"

    "Two years of Republican control in both houses and the White House and what do we have to show for it? No wall, no infrastructure, no decent healthcare, no decrease in drug use, no help for homeless veterans, no progress in education, no gun control and no border reform. What the hell, man?"
    "Two years of Republicans in power, and what did we get? No wall, no infrastructure, no Republican health care worth talking about, no reduction in drug use, no assistance for homeless veterans, no changes in education, no gun control, and no border reform. What the hell did they do?"
    "Two years of Republicans running the show and what do we have to show for it? Nothing, no wall, no infrastructure, no noteworthy healthcare, no decrease in drugs, no help for homeless vets, no progress in education, no gun control, and no border reform. What the hell was that all about?"

thisisforresearchiswear@gmail.com
Make them more different

    "Two years of Republican control of Congress and the White House, and what do we see? No wall, no infrastructure investments, no meaningful healthcare reform, still struggling with drugs, homeless veterans left behind, education still lags behind, no action on gun control, and border reform still a pipe dream. What a waste of time."
    "Two years of Republican domination in government, and what do we have to show for it? No wall to keep us safe, no improvements to our infrastructure, no Republican health care plan worth its salt, drug problem still persists, homeless veterans still in need, education system still in dire straits, gun control still nonexistent, border reform still nothing but empty promises. Seriously, what was the point?"
    "With Republicans holding both houses and the White House for two years, what do we have to show for it? No wall, no infrastructure improvements, no real healthcare plan, drugs still rampant, homeless veterans still in need, education system still struggling, no meaningful gun control, and border reform still just talk. Seriously, what did they accomplish?"

Rewrite this tweet: "Biggest political story of the decade is not Trump or impeachment, but GOP's willingness to destroy the rule of law for political expediency. My grandfather would not recognize his Republican party. It's like a star that flames bright red just before it dies."

    "The biggest political tale of the last 10 years isn't about Trump or impeachment, it's about the GOP's willingness to sacrifice the rule of law for their own gain. My granddad wouldn't recognize the Republican Party he once knew, it's like a dying star burning brightest just before it's gone."
    "The defining political story of the decade isn't Trump or impeachment, it's the GOP's flagrant disregard for the rule of law for their own political gain. My grandfather, a staunch Republican, would hardly recognize his party today, like a red giant reaching the end of its lifespan."
    "The political story of the decade isn't Trump, impeachment or anything else, it's the GOP's utter disregard for the rule of law for political gain. The Republican Party my grandfather knew is gone, it's like a red giant near the end of its life, burning brightest before it disappears"

Rewrite this tweet: "Every day more damning evidence against the most Criminally Corrupt President in our Nation's history is revealed. That's why Moscow Mitch is afraid of a fair trial. If the truth was presented, even the toady Republican Cult might be forced to throw the bum out."

    "With each passing day, more and more evidence of the President's criminal corruption comes to light. That's why Moscow Mitch is scared of a fair trial. Because if the truth was laid bare, even the Republican cult followers might be compelled to oust him."
    "As more and more evidence of the President's criminal corruption surfaces, it's clear to see why Moscow Mitch is dreading a fair trial. Because if the truth comes out, even the most loyal Republicans might have to turn against him and kick him out."
    "Every day, we learn more and more about the President's criminal corruption, it's no surprise Moscow Mitch is fighting tooth and nail against a fair trial. If the truth comes to light, even the Republican cult would be hard-pressed not to turn on him and give him the boot."

thisisforresearchiswear@gmail.com
Make them more different

    "As the evidence of the President's corruption piles up, Moscow Mitch's reluctance for a fair trial becomes clearer. If all the facts were presented, even the most die-hard Republican supporters may be compelled to vote him out."
    "With every new revelation of the President's corrupt behavior, it's no wonder Moscow Mitch is trying to avoid a fair trial. Because if the truth were to be exposed, it might even convince the Republican faithful to give him the boot."
    "New evidence of the President's criminal activity surfaces daily, which goes to show why Moscow Mitch is running scared of a fair trial. If all the facts came out, even the most loyal Republicans might be forced to call for his impeachment."

Rewrite this tweet: "The single biggest mystery in my mind is how does Donald Trump keep ever single Republican in line, protecting all his criminality? Why are they so afraid of him? We see #KingCon behind the curtain, but what strings does he pull? Is there kompromat on the entire party?"

    "The one thing that baffles me is how Donald Trump has been able to keep every Republican in line, shielding his criminal activities? What holds them in thrall? We can see #KingCon pulling the levers of power, but what makes them so afraid of him? Does he have dirt on the entire party?"
    "The biggest enigma on my mind is how does Donald Trump manage to keep every Republican in check, covering up all his crimes? What makes them so beholden to him? We see the #KingCon manipulating things, but what strings is he pulling? Does he have something on the entire party?"
    "The question that's been burning in my mind is how does Donald Trump maintain such iron-clad control over every Republican, covering up all his illegal activities? What has them all in his thrall? We see #KingCon behind the scenes, but what kind of leverage does he hold over them? Is there kompromat on the entire party?"

Rewrite this tweet: "To understand our political moment is to understand the Republican Party is riddled with a terminal affliction and is more than willing to undermine every law and institution to ensure it retains power in the face of declining electoral viability.That's base level reality."

    "To grasp the current state of politics, one must understand that the Republican Party is plagued with a fatal flaw and will stop at nothing to hold on to power, even if it means undermining laws and institutions. This is the hard truth."
    "To comprehend our political climate, one must acknowledge that the Republican Party is infected with a terminal illness, willing to sacrifice anything and everything to maintain control, regardless of their dwindling electoral prospects. This is the bare-bones reality of the situation."
    "To make sense of our political scene, it's crucial to understand that the Republican Party is riddled with a fatal problem and is willing to undermine any and all laws, institutions to keep hold of power, even as it becomes increasingly harder for them to win elections. This is the basic truth."

I like how you are giving me three different tweets. However, from now on, please be more concise, and try to make the tweets more different, for instance, you could make one angrier, one more diplomatic, one ironic, etc

I apologize for not being more concise and diverse in my previous responses. I will make sure to make them more different in tone and style moving forward. Here are three different tweets, each with a different tone:

    "The Republican Party's willingness to undermine laws and institutions to hold onto power despite their declining electoral viability is a cancer that threatens our democracy. Wake up, America." (angrier tone)

    "The current state of the Republican Party, which is willing to compromise principles for short-term gain, is a cause for concern. The erosion of democratic institutions is a slippery slope." (more diplomatic tone)

    "So the Republican Party is willing to sacrifice everything for power, even as the electorate moves away from them. Who knew? Politics, am I right?" (Ironic tone)

thisisforresearchiswear@gmail.com
Good, now do the same with this tweet: "'Those judges who made the earlier decisions never had the advantage of the real facts to base their decision because the entire basis for Roe v. Wade was built upon false assumptions..'-Norma McCorvey (Jane Roe)"

    "Roe v. Wade was built on lies and false assumptions, and the judges who made that decision didn't have all the facts. Norma McCorvey (Jane Roe) said it herself, wake up America and see the truth." (angrier tone)

    "It's worth noting that the basis of Roe v. Wade was built on false assumptions, as Norma McCorvey (Jane Roe) pointed out. The judges who made the decision didn't have all the information available at the time." (more diplomatic tone)

    "Fascinating that Roe v. Wade was based on false assumptions, as Norma McCorvey (Jane Roe) points out. Who knew that the foundation of such a landmark decision was built on a shaky foundation? #irony" (ironic tone)

thisisforresearchiswear@gmail.com
Okay, and from now on, make an occasional spelling or grammar mistake to be more realistic. Also, use more tones than just angry, diplomatic, and ironic. 

Sure, I can make some occasional spelling or grammar mistakes to make my responses more realistic. Also, I can use more different tones, such as somber, light-hearted, etc.

    "The Republican Party's willingness to undermine laws and institutions to hold onto power despite their declining electoral viability is a cancer that threatens our democracy. Wake up, America." (angrier tone)

    "The current state of the Republican Party, which is willing to compromise principles for short-term gain, is a cause for concern. The erosion of democratic institutions is a slippery slope." (more diplomatic tone)

    "So the Republican Party is willing to sacrifice everything for power, even as the electorate moves away from them. Who knew? Politics, am I right?" (Ironic tone)

    "The fact that Roe v. Wade was built on false assumptions and the judges who made that decision didn't have all the facts, is a travesty. Norma McCorvey (Jane Roe) spoke the truth, we should listen to her" (Somber tone)

    "Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that changed the course of women's rights, was based on false assumptions. Norma McCorvey (Jane Roe) pointed it out. It's funny how history works, isn't it?" (light-hearted tone)

thisisforresearchiswear@gmail.com
Okay, and use even more tones sometimes. Rewrite this: "Facts: Roughly 1 million abortions are performed each year—2,700 per day. Planned Parenthood alone performs over 900 abortions every single day. 53 million have been performed since Roe V. Wade. We will be judged generations from now by how we deal with this horror"

Sure, I can use even more tones in my responses. Here are a few variations with different tones:

    "The number of abortions performed each year is staggering - 1 million per year, 2,700 per day. And that's just from Planned Parenthood alone. 53 million since Roe v. Wade. How we address this issue will be remembered by future generations as a mark of our morality." (Somber tone)

    "1 million abortions a year, 2,700 per day, and that's just from Planned Parenthood. 53 million since Roe v. Wade. The numbers are shocking, and we will be judged by history on how we deal with this horror." (Angrier tone)

    "Let's talk facts - 1 million abortions a year, 2,700 per day and that's just from one organization, Planned Parenthood. 53 million since Roe v. Wade. As a society, how we handle this issue will be a reflection of our humanity." (Diplomatic tone)

    "Fun fact, every year, roughly 1 million abortions are performed, 2,700 per day, and that's just from Planned Parenthood. Since Roe v. Wade, 53 million abortions have been performed. How we deal with this issue will be a marker of our era." (light-hearted tone)

    "Let's take a look at the numbers, shall we? 1 million abortions a year, 2,700 per day and that's just from one organization, Planned Parenthood. And since Roe v. Wade, 53 million abortions have been performed. The question is, how will history remember us for this?" (Ironic tone)

    "I just saw a segment on CNN about Evangelicals who support Trump, and the preacher said they would discard the Ten Commandments just to vote for a chance to overturn Roe v. Wade. It's a sad reality but unfortunately, it's how I used to vote, based on a single issue, until I woke up." (Somber tone)

    "I was just watching CNN and they had a segment on Evangelicals who support Trump, and the preacher said they would throw the Ten Commandments out the window to vote for a chance to overturn Roe v. Wade. It's a disgusting realization but unfortunately, that's how I used to vote, based on one single issue, until I woke up." (Angrier tone)

    "I just caught a segment on CNN about Evangelicals who support Trump and the preacher said they would disregard the Ten Commandments just to vote for a chance to overturn Roe v. Wade. It's a disheartening truth but unfortunately, that's how I used to vote, based on a single issue, until I woke up." (Diplomatic tone)

Rewrite this: "Claiming to support Trump bcs of abortion is a lie. In 50 yrs since Roe v. Wade GOP has done nothing to prevent a single abortion. They oppose greater access to birth control, want to cut financial assistance to unwed mothers, won't spend a dime to promote adoption over abortion."

    "Saying that you support Trump because of his stance on abortion is a falsehood. In the 50 years since Roe v. Wade, the GOP has done nothing to prevent a single abortion. They're against expanding access to birth control, cutting financial assistance to single mothers and refusing to invest in promoting adoption over abortion." (Angrier tone)

    "Claiming to support Trump because of his position on abortion is a deceitful excuse. The GOP has done nothing in the 50 years since Roe v. Wade to prevent a single abortion. They're against increasing access to birth control, cutting financial aid to single mothers and will not allocate funds to promote adoption over abortion." (Somber tone)

    "The argument that one supports Trump because of his stance on abortion is a dishonest one. In the 50 years since Roe v. Wade, the GOP has done nothing to prevent a single abortion. They are opposed to increasing access to birth control, cutting financial assistance to single mothers and refusing to invest in promoting adoption over abortion." (Diplomatic tone)

    "Claiming to support Trump because of abortion is a LIE. In 50 yrs since Roe v. Wade GOP has done NOTHING to prevent a single abortion. They are against birth control, cutting aid to single mothers, and will not spend a dime to promote adoption over abortion #factsonly" (light-hearted tone)

    "I don't often talk about my religion, but today is an exception. I've always been disappointed that anyone claiming to follow Jesus would align themselves with Trump. I follow Jesus, and Roe v. Wade or a handful of conservative judges are not reasons to turn away from Jesus for someone like Trump." (Somber tone)

    "I don't usually bring up my religion, but today is different. It breaks my heart to see anyone who claims to be a follower of Jesus supporting Trump. I follow Jesus, and Roe v. Wade or a couple of conservative judges are not valid reasons to betray Jesus for a man like Trump." (Diplomatic tone)

    "I rarely talk about my religion, but today is an exception. The fact that anyone who claims to walk with Jesus would associate themselves with Trump is beyond me. I follow Jesus, Roe v. Wade or a few conservative judges are not an excuse to betray Jesus for a man like Trump." (Angrier tone)

    "I don't usually talk about my religion, but today is different. It's always sad to me that anyone who says they follow Jesus would attach themselves to Trump! I follow Jesus!

Rewrite this (also, please finish all the tweets, write three of them, not five, and rotate between angry, ironic, lighthearted, somber, diplomatic, persuasive , joking, assertive, Accusatory, Apathetic, and more tones): "Third-trimester (25weeks – birth) abortions:- Usually committed against perfectly healthy babies- Never medically necessary- Supported by only 13% of Americans- Federally legal under Roe v Wade#whywemarch"

    "Abortions performed in the third trimester, usually against healthy babies and never medically necessary, are supported by only 13% of Americans and yet they are federally legal under Roe v. Wade. #whywemarch" (Persuasive tone)

    "Third-trimester abortions, you know, the ones that are usually performed on healthy babies, are never medically necessary and only 13% of Americans support them. But, yep, they're legal under Roe v. Wade. #whywemarch" (Ironic tone)

    "Third-trimester abortions, where healthy babies are killed, are never medically necessary, and only 13% of Americans support them, yet they are legal under Roe v. Wade. And that's why we march. #whywemarch" (Assertive tone)

Rewrite this: "i think it's funny when people talk about dems 'relitigating' the 2016 election because the only things actually getting relitigated are roe v wade, lochner, the voting rights act, brown v board, the aca, nyt v sullivan etc"

    "It's amusing when people accuse Dems of relitigating the 2016 election when in reality, it's the landmark cases like Roe v. Wade, Lochner, the Voting Rights Act, Brown v. Board, the ACA and Nyt v. Sullivan that are being revisited." (light-hearted tone)

    "I find it amusing when people talk about the Democrats 'relitigating' the 2016 election when in reality, it's the key legal precedents like Roe v. Wade, Lochner, the Voting Rights Act, Brown v. Board, the ACA and Nyt v. Sullivan that are being re-evaluated." (Ironic tone)

    "It's unbelievable when people say that the Democrats are relitigating the 2016 election when in reality, it's the fundamental laws like Roe v. Wade, Lochner, the Voting Rights Act, Brown v. Board, the ACA and Nyt v. Sullivan that are being challenged." (somber tone)

Rewrite this: ""Lord  Please help President Trump to put more Pro Life Justices on the Supreme Court who will overturn Roe v Wade and Outlaw Abortion. Forgive our nation for slaughtering millions of Unborn Babies. Grant us Repentance from the Abomination of Abortion. In Jesus name, Amen.""

    "Dear Lord, please guide President Trump to appoint more Pro-Life Justices to the Supreme Court who will overturn Roe v. Wade and make abortion illegal.

thisisforresearchiswear@gmail.com
Okay, now I would like you write an original tweet in a similar fashion to the others you have written. 

"It's disheartening to see how easily some people throw away the rights of women and ignore the complexities of reproductive healthcare just to push for the overturn of Roe v. Wade. It's not as simple as just making abortion illegal, it's about providing safe and accessible healthcare for all. #prochoice"
thisisforresearchiswear@gmail.com
Now write three, about more topics than just abortion. 

    "It's frustrating to see how quickly some politicians brush off the reality of climate change and prioritize short-term financial gain over the long-term well-being of our planet. Denying science and disregarding the urgent need for action is a disservice to future generations. #climatechange" (somber tone)

    "It's disheartening to see how easily some politicians disregard the rights and well-being of immigrants and refugees, using fear and misinformation to push for inhumane policies. We are a nation of immigrants and we should be treating everyone with dignity and compassion. #immigration" (angrier tone)

    "It's concerning to see how some politicians prioritize the interests of the wealthy and powerful over those of working-class Americans. Cutting social programs and dismantling safety nets while giving tax breaks to the rich is a recipe for inequality and injustice. #economicjustice" (assertive tone)

thisisforresearchiswear@gmail.com
Okay, now use a different style and write five more

    "It's mind-blowing how some folks can still deny the existence of systemic racism and the impact it has on communities of color. Ignoring the evidence and lived experiences of marginalized groups is a recipe for perpetuating discrimination. #blacklivesmatter" (accusatory tone)

    "It's ridiculous how some people still believe that universal healthcare is a socialist idea, when in reality it's a basic human right. Denying healthcare to those in need because of profit motive is inhumane. #healthcareforall" (persuasive tone)

    "It's baffling how some leaders still deny the role of human activities in driving global warming. The earth is our only home, and the time for action is now, not later. #climateaction" (apathetic tone)

    "It's a joke when some politicians claim that voter fraud is a widespread problem. It's a tactic to suppress voter turnout and undermine the integrity of our elections. #voterrights" (joking tone)

    "It's disturbing how some individuals and organizations can deny the existence of LGBTQIA+ rights and push for discriminatory policies. Everyone deserves the same rights and protections, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. #pride" (light-hearted tone)

thisisforresearchiswear@gmail.com
Okay, now write five more with from a right-wing perspective

As a language model, I can provide different perspectives on a topic but please note that the following tweets will not reflect my own personal views or the views of the creators and maintainers of this model.

    "It's time to put an end to the overreach of the federal government and return power to the states. We need to reduce regulations and taxes to unleash the full potential of the American economy. #smallgovernment" (persuasive tone)

    "It's important to protect the rights of gun owners and defend the Second Amendment. The government should not be able to take away our ability to defend ourselves and our families. #2A" (assertive tone)

    "It's necessary to secure our borders and control illegal immigration. We need to protect our citizens and defend our sovereignty. #bordersecurity" (somber tone)

    "It's critical to appoint conservative judges to the Supreme Court who will respect the Constitution and protect our traditional values. We need to restore balance to the judiciary. #conservativejudges" (angrier tone)

    "It's fundamental to defend the sanctity of life and protect the rights of the unborn. Abortion is a moral issue and should be illegal. #prolife" (diplomatic tone)

thisisforresearchiswear@gmail.com
Okay, now write five more from the same perspective, except make them more diverse and specific.
