Democrats used social media to alter the outcome of elections.\n\nOnly those with their heads up the fake news media’s backsides didn’t know this.

I threatened them; I harassed them; I called them names…\n\nThis is exactly the behavior I’m seeing from the people being exposed by Musk’s releases. The evidence is undeniable; it’s their own words, for Pete’s sake! So they’re going after Musk personally.\n\nThe other very common response I see when someone is “busted” is to try to shift blame. Even before Musk took over, media was talking about how Musk would become a threat to free speech, and how that much power could affect elections, sway public opinion. And voila! That is precisely what we now know they were doing.\n\nIf you want to know what deviousness the left is up to, just listen to what they are accusing someone else of doing. It really is that simple.",

Or if, during periods of mass arrests, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, paling with terror at every bang of the down-stairs door and at every step on the staircase, but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of a half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else was at hand? After all, you knew ahead of time that those bluecaps were out at night for no good purpose. And you could be sure ahead of time that you'd be cracking the skull of a cutthroat. Or what about the Black Maria sitting out there on the street with one lonely chauffeur - what if it had been driven off of or its tires spiked? The Organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and, notwithstanding all of Stalin's thirst, the cursed machine would have ground to a halt.\"\n\n\"If .... if... We didn't love freedom enough. And even more-we had no awareness of the real situation. We spent ourselves in one unrestrained outburst in 1917, and then we hurried to submit. We submitted with pleasure! (Arthur Ransome describes a workers' meeting in Yaroslavi in 1921. Delegates sent to the workers from the Central Committee in Moscow to confer on the substance of the argument about trade unions. The representative of the opposition, Y. Larin, explained to the workers that their trade union must be their defense against the administration, that they possessed rights which they had won and upon which no one else had any right to infringe. The workers, however, were completely indifferent, simply not comprehending whom they still needed to be defended against and why they still needed any rights. When the spokesman for the Party line rebuked them for their laziness and for getting out of hand, and demanded sacrifices from them-overtime work without pay, reductions in food, military discipline in the factory administration-this aroused great elation and applause.) We purely and simply deserved everything that happened afterward.\"\n\nAleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn, The Gulag Archipelago Page 13, fn 5:\n\nCopyright 1973 ISBN 0-06-080332-0 (pbk.)Harper and Row",
