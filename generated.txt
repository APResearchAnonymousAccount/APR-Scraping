Text: The only way for them to achieve their dream of a world full of helpless, malleable, good little baby citizens, is to take those guns away.



Text: The left has had a stranglehold on the media for so long that now the entire country has been brainwashed into believing that the only way to make a change is to surrender our guns.

They want to make the United States into a totalitarian state, where all dissent is crushed. The only way to "save" the country is to exterminate the "inferior" races, starting with the "gun-toting" whiteys. The Aryan Nation will rise again! The liberals have a long history of trying to destroy our culture.

Text: Totalitarian control. So they will take away our guns and give them to the criminals. The Gov't can then take our guns and they can be disarmed.

 Text: They want to create a new world in which the people are totally controlled by the State through the implementation of their globalist agenda. They don't want to kill us, they want to make us so brainwashed and controlled that we wont notice that they are trying to destroy our nation until its too late.
Text: The goal is to have no free thinking at all, the people will be brainwashed and controlled. The liberal media will be the biggest propaganda machine ever created.

Text: They don't want to risk anything that might get in the way of there goal of taking over the country. The problem is, they are never going to succeed if the citizens fight back. Dems
/libs have proven time and time again that they have no real interest in peace, love or any other hippie ideals. They are power hungry wolves and they will stop at nothing to fulfill their bloodthirsty lust for control and power over the masses. They are tyrants through and through.


Text: There is no "liberal ideal" behind gun control. There is only the Marxist-Leninist ideal of central planning by a totalitarian government with absolute control over the lives of every citizen. The liberal-arts ideal of a free people who are self-governing is a threat to the Marxist-Leninist ideal, so liberals must come up with a new enemy.
This is why the left has always been anti-gun. They have never been about "gun safety". They have always been about "gun control".
The left is just another oppressive force in history like the nazis or the communists. They are all trying to create a new world order. If you think the "gun issue" is just about "gun safety" and "gun rights", then you are playing right into their hands.
Don't fall for it. Don't let them brainwash you. Don't allow them to create a new enemy to divide the country on.


Text: You know who else had total control? The nazis. The russians. The castros. The same people that we fought in WW2. They did it for the same reason, to take away the guns from the people, and to take away the freedom of the people. We can't let them do it again. We have to stand up and fight, because if we don't, it will be our freedom, and our freedom will be their boot prints.

Text: It's about taking away our rights for the greater good. It's about controlling our lives and our opinions. It's about making sure that we don't have a voice in our own government. They want to create a utopia, but they're too corrupt and incompetent to do it.

That's why they have to destroy our way of life, so that they can be free to implement their way.
