In 6 days when Democrats are crying over the fake January 6th ANNIVERSARY crap, I‚Äôm just gonna sit back and laugh that Liz & Nancy both lost their jobs over it.
-------
Democrats put American families last.

Republicans are ready to restore affordability.
-------
How soon until Democrats try to legalize pedophilia in all 50 states?

#LiberalismIsAMentalDisease
-------
To the immigrants of United States,

The Republicans want to maintain this country for the reasons you came. 
The democrats want to change it to the countries you came from. 

Keep America same.

#DemocratsHateAmerica
-------
Why are there so much crime in democrat run states? 

Do they like the crime?
-------
If you think the left and democrats are mad at me now because I keep bringing up Paul Pelosi‚Äôs butt party just wait until I start drinking later. My demented mind is at work for later.üòÅüòÅüòÅ
-------
Democrats want to give you something for nothing. When you try to get something for nothing, you usually end up getting nothing for something.‚Äú

-------
The Democrat-media mob feeding on President Trump‚Äôs private tax returns like out of control piranha.  It‚Äôs truly a disgusting spectacle.  So much for ‚Äúprivacy.‚Äù  Let‚Äôs hope their tax returns are made public, now that the precedent has been set.
-------
Republicans' new year's resolution should be to STOP D.C. Democrats' reckless tax and spend spree and HOLD Democrats accountable for their failed economic policies.
-------
For the past two years, the American people have suffered from crisis after crisis because of failed one-party Democrat rule in Washington. 

In 3 days, that ENDS.
-------
Democrats, if you can‚Äôt define what a woman is, how can you identify a #MAGAMoron?
-------
I went over the 2022 midterms and MY GOODNESS. 

It‚Äôs barely a GOP majority. 

No Zeldin pulling up candidates, no DeSantis redistricting map, and it‚Äôs in Democrat control. 

I don‚Äôt think people realize the peril the country is in. 

Nor recognize the solutions and leaders.
-------
Sooo... all the Democrats who became millionaires while in Congress are concerned about Trump's money... which he lost hundreds of millions of while he was President... got it.
-------
What year will it be when the Democrats stop talking about Trump's tax returns? 2050?
-------
Am I the only one who thinks that the democrats are pushing for Michele Obama to run in the next  presidential elections?
-------
I will not take the GOP seriously again until they treat Democrats the way Democrats treat them. When will they go after the tax returns of the Clintons and Bidens? When will they kick Democrats off of House committees? When will they impeach Biden?
-------
Remember when democrats impeached President Trump for a phone call to Ukraine?
Yeah, he got too close to what was really happening: MONEY LAUNDERING billions of dollars of taxpayer money.

-------
The Electoral College and the Second Amendment are the only reasons America is still a (somewhat) free country.

It‚Äôs no coincidence that Democrats are opposed to both.
-------
Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green is melting down and vowing payback for Democrats releasing Trump‚Äôs tax returns.
-------
What Malcolm X said about being political chumps is still applicable today. 

But it doesn't only apply to black folks and democrats anymore.

It applies to folks voting for Team Red or Team Blue expecting them to do what they say.

But they won't. Because you're a chump.
-------
Trump‚Äôs tax returns are a complete nothing burger - another Democrat farce distraction.
-------
The Rino establishment has betrayed us to many times 

Republicans won‚Äôt be able to stop democrats or accomplish anything until RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel, McCarthy and McConnell are removed from leadership!  It‚Äôs time!
-------
i‚Äôve got vegan friends, meat eater friends, anti hunting friends, friends who make a living hunting, democrat friends, republican friends, pro gun friends, anti gun friends, friends of all kinds. 

u dont have to be a douchebag bc ur opinions differ. have a debate, be respectful.
-------
President Trump is sending 100 Marines into Iraq after the embassy attack.

Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton did NOTHING while our embassy was being attacked in Benghazi.

That is the difference between Republicans and Democrats!
-------
In the coming year I will be supporting every democrat running for office in every race in the US. I will tweet, retweet and do all I can to get their voice out. I believe we must crush the GOP to save our country.
-------
Why don‚Äôt Republicans start playing the same game as globalist Democrats?

How about we start importing hundreds of thousands of Patriotic ‚Äúrefugees‚Äù from Hong Kong, Poland, and other Freedom-loving countries and stack them in deep blue districts?

Best part? We‚Äôll do it legally
-------
What the hell are Mitch McConnell and the Senate Republicans waiting for?  Declare the House Democrats‚Äô impeachment null and void NOW!  The House left for a long recess before sending the articles to the Senate.  Enough!  The speaker doesn‚Äôt run the country.
-------
Democrats don‚Äôt need trump voters to win. We need white progressives and people of color. And we need to ensure people of color can actually vote. 

But this incessant need to chase white trump voters like fucking Ahab chasing that whale is inane.
-------
gun violence isn‚Äôt a democrat or republican issue. it‚Äôs a uniquely american issue, and we must address it as such. to blur the lines of partisanship means to save lives.

-------
I don‚Äôt expect any US president, Republican or Democrat, to completely align with my beliefs or hopes. But I do expect that I shouldn‚Äôt have to wake every day wondering what new way has he betrayed America and our constitutionally defined values and laws.
-------
To Democrats:
Equality = Freedom

To Republicans:
Equality = Oppression
-------
Started the decade as a politically unaware conservative (in my defense I was 13, had no idea about anything, and my parents were always conservative so I usually just followed them). Ending the decade as a democratic socialist/social democrat depending on the day. Love to see it
-------
you might reasonably argue the Democrats didn't get much done in the first 2 years of the Obama Administration because they didn't want to, but I think a significant factor was the recent belief that Dems were entering a Thousand Year Supermajority and it was ok to procrastinate
-------
True story: I had a dream that I asked a group of people whether they think if Democrats win the Senate they will get rid of the filibuster to try to pass climate policy. I have hardly given this a moment's thought in my real life, why oh why am I dreaming about it?
-------
Are Republicans really weak?

Or are they being blackmailed by Democrats?

In other words, is the Republican laundry just as dirty as the Democrat laundry?
-------
AOC, the "squad", Hillary Clinton and the DemocRATS don't want you to like this tweet. You know what to do.
-------
While I do deeply approve of several Democrats decision to finance their election campaigns entirely on small grassroots donations, once youre on their mailing list you get asked for money so often you start to feel like the only guy with a stable job in a family of crack addicts
