So I guess we‚Äôve reached the place where if you publicly disagree with the Left‚Äôs favorite paid actor brat @GretaThunberg, you get arrested. Wow! Climate change STUPIDITY has reached peak insanity.
-------
I know this sounds absolutely crazy.

But a company is now spraying toxic chemicals (sulfur dioxide) into the atmosphere in order to BLOCK OUT THE SUN to stop climate change.

This is evil.
-------
Jane Goodall at the WEF forum just said, "We can solve climate change by depopulating the earth by a mere 7.5 billion people." Is she volunteering to go first?
-------
The biggest threat to America is not Russia. It‚Äôs not climate change. It‚Äôs not an ‚Äúinsurrection.‚Äù

It‚Äôs our own government.
-------
I‚Äôm stuck between a rock and a hard place with this uni assignment which the text is all about how humans and capitalism caused climate change and those who disagree  are ‚Äòclimate deniers‚Äô - do I call it out, lose marks and risk my trip to Oz or write stuff I think is bs?
-------
The temperature is up to 8 degrees here in Ontario. 

We will all be dead from climate change by tomorrow.

This is the fault of the unvaccinated.
-------
The WEF is using their insidious climate change agenda to enslave you.

You will be eating bugs.

You will own nothing and be happy.
-------
What makes Greta Thunberg a climate change expert at the ripe old age of 19?
-------
Most people believe in climate change 

Only a fraction of the population - less than 10% in the US - are truly dismissive
-------
Hmmmm‚Ä¶. So you admit the Inflation Reduction Act meant to fight INFLATION, was actually a con to get a bill signed to combat climate change since no one in our government actually reads anything past the trendy titles ü§î
-------
The science is abundantly clear: ignoring climate change is not an option.
-------
It‚Äôs not your fault there‚Äôs microplastics in your body and it‚Äôs not your fault there‚Äôs climate change. One individual‚Äôs actions cannot make up for pollution caused by massive corporations and the military.
-------
I am opposed to Lockdowns, masks&Vaccines to deal with Covid as it's clear that they were counterproductive.
But I find that many people who think like me on Covid are climate change deniers&call it a conspiracy theory.
They are totally wrong here. Climate change is real& serious
-------
Why isn't anyone dying suddenly from climate change...
-------
Okay Greta is a bit dramatic for me but it really is crazy that teenagers are driving the conversation on climate change when they‚Äôre not the ones impacting it. Companies and governments need to do more fr
-------
Things to remember going into the new year:

-The government doesn‚Äôt care about you
-The media will lie to you
-There is no climate change crisis
-There are only two genders
-They profit off of you being sick

What a beautiful country we live in! As Canadians, we have so much to be thankful for. I am thinking today, that no one is bombing my country, that we have a stable, democratic and compassionate government.
I know also that inflation will ease, but climate change will not .
-------
Nothing says you're worried about climate change like buying beachfront property on Martha's Vineyard, flying in a private jet, and owning multiple vehicles. 

It's a total scam. 

The rules they're coming up with to combat the 'climate crisis' will not apply to them, only you.
-------
Climate change is not a ‚Äúleft versus right‚Äù issue ‚Äî it‚Äôs just a reality. What we do about it, might be political. But partisan politics is not an excuse for denialism.
