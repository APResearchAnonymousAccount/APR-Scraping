Drugs are winning the war on drugs.
-------
Let it be known that some activists in Chicago were pushing total decriminalization over legalization, or both. With legalization, those unlicensed, who sell large quantities of weed, will be targeted by law enforcement. 

Thus continuing the War on Drugs.
-------
A damming example of how abysmal a failure the war on drugs has been is that almost everyone who’s smoked weed in a place where it’s illegal has found themselves in a situation where they can get illegal drugs, but not a legal pipe to smoke them out of.
-------
The war on drugs is a hate crime.
-------
The war on drugs brought in more drugs. And the war on terrorists created more terrorists.

Maybe next year we can have a war on science listeners.
-------
Ending the war on drugs would destroy cartels. They’d be forced to do something else. In the US, the mafias that’s ran booze became beverage distributors that still operate today!
-------
We waged an entire War On Drugs because people of color were smoking marijuana and crack. 

Today, on my television, I saw a commercial for a brand name suboxone...  

Acting like opioid addiction is just the same as high blood pressure or diabetes...
-------
The “war on drugs” doesn’t work and it fuels a corrupt system that exploits prisoners for labor.
-------
I’m against the smoking age being raised for the same reason I despise the war on drugs. The government keeps finding new ways to take more and more control over individual choices and autonomy. “My body, my choice” applies across the board
-------
The case against disgraced senator #LeilaDeLima is another proof that war on drugs is not war against the poor. Another yellow propaganda debunked.

if you’re not smoking resin you’re supporting the war on drugs and an imperialist
-------
The War on Drugs is largely responsible for the militarization of police forces in America. 

It has pitted police against citizens and this is unfair to both. 

Police need to be able to focus on protecting the American public from violent offenders and fraud.
