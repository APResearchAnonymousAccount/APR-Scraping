"Those judges who made the earlier decisions never had the advantage of the real facts to base their decision because the entire basis for Roe v. Wade was built upon false assumptions..." -Norma McCorvey (Jane Roe)

Facts:

Roughly 1 million abortions are performed each year‚Äî2,700 per day

Planned Parenthood alone performs over 900 abortions every single day

53 million have been performed since Roe V. Wade

We will be judged generations from now by how we deal with this horror

Just watched a segment on CNN about Evangelicals that support trump,the preacher who was talking said they would throw the 10 Commandments out the window just to vote for a chance to overturn Roe v Wade,So true,unfortunately that's how I use to vote,one issue,until I woke up
-------
"No one ever explained that there were options to abortion, that financial help was available, or that the child was unique and irreplaceable." -Norma McCorvey (Jane Roe of Roe v. Wade)
-------
Claiming to support Trump bcs of abortion is a lie. In 50 yrs since Roe v. Wade GOP has done nothing to prevent a single abortion. They oppose greater access to birth control, want to cut financial assistance to unwed mothers, won‚Äôt spend a dime to promote adoption over abortion.
-------
I rarely, speak about my religion; however, today I will.

I've always been saddened that ANYONE that claims to walk with Jesus, would attach their balloon to Trump!
I follow Jesus!

Roe v Wade or a few conservative judges are not a reason to betray Jesus, for man such as Trump!
-------
Lord, forgive us for shedding the innocent Blood of millions of Unborn Babies. 
Grant us Mercy, Repentance and Forgiveness. 
Help President Trump to put more Pro Life Justices on the Supreme Court who will overturn Roe v Wade and Outlaw Abortion. In Jesus name Amen.

üëã Hey, #DemDebate moderators: States like Missouri & Georgia have been passing unconstitutional abortion bans in an effort to chip away at Roe v. Wade. What will candidates do to strengthen Roe? #AskAboutAbortion
-------
When an evangelical's position is: "You can shit on the dead husband of a recently widowed woman, put kids in cages, and kiss Vladimir Putin's ass, so long as I get a judge who hates Roe v Wade," I am unmoved by their moral objections to comments from Jeffrey Toobin.

Third-trimester (25weeks ‚Äì birth) abortions:
- Usually committed against perfectly healthy babies
- Never medically necessary
- Supported by only 13% of Americans
- Federally legal under Roe v Wade

Today is the 46th anniversary of the #Helms Amendment. Enacted following the #RoevWade decision, Helms restricts US foreign aid for abortion. This policy has not only limited the reach & effectiveness of US global health assistance, but it continues to threaten SRHR worldwide.

i think it‚Äôs funny when people talk about dems ‚Äúrelitigating‚Äù the 2016 election because the only things actually getting relitigated are roe v wade, lochner, the voting rights act, brown v board, the aca, nyt v sullivan etc

Trump thought Roe v. Wade was a decision Washington had to make when he got to the Delaware River. #cbreez

"It is my participation in this case that began the tragedy, and it is with great hope that I now seek to end the tragedy that I began." -Norma McCorvey, Jane Roe in Roe v. Wade

SOS: I'm at committee meeting listening to anti abortion people calling my volunteers murderers, saying roe v Wade is EVIL, saying abortion is wiping out the white race. Please send pictures of yoongi so I can get through this without screaming.
-------
I consider myself pro-life, though overturning Roe v Wade isn‚Äôt the answer. 

And as a Christian, for the life of me, I don‚Äôt get why Jesus didn‚Äôt say a word about #abortion, even though it was a common ancient practice.
-------
Let this sink in: Roe v. Wade is almost 47. And too many people are STILL not able to access the abortion care they need due to income and ZIP code. It's past time to #BeBoldEndHyde
-------
Emboldened by the Trump administration, anti-choice extremists in states across the country are mounting an all-out attack on women‚Äôs reproductive freedom. It's time to codify Roe v. Wade and ensure that our rights are non-negotiable.
-------
John James‚Äô out-of-touch record on women‚Äôs health care: Supports overturning Roe v. Wade, opposes abortion rights even in cases of rape and incest, refuses to support exceptions ‚Äúto save the life of the mother.‚Äù #MISen

In a candidate, i need to hear they will 
  Enable climate change prevention policies 
Re enact   aca 
Save roe v wade
Get back into the good graces of world leaders 
Prosecute jamal koshogghis killer
Figure out how to disqualify all trumps judicial appts
...
-------
Lord  Please help President Trump to put more Pro Life Justices on the Supreme Court who will overturn Roe v Wade and Outlaw Abortion. 
Forgive our nation for slaughtering millions of Unborn Babies. Grant us Repentance from the Abomination of Abortion. 
In Jesus name, Amen.

Ill say what some conservatives are afraid to say.

1. Every state should have voter ID laws. It should be mandatory.

2. Roe v wade should be overturned because it was based on a lie.

3. Trans women are NOT actual women. That‚Äôs impossible.
-------
Roe v. Wade was ajudicated in 1973.

Since SCOTUS's decision, 46 percent of the black population has been aborted.

The rate of abortion per capital, white vs black is nearly FOUR TIMES GREATER for Black babies.

Why do democrats want black babies killed?
-------
‚ÄúAbortion rights are human rights. They are also economic rights.‚Äù

We won‚Äôt go back, and we‚Äôve seen this year how quickly we can unless we codify Roe v. Wade into law.

@ewarren
 has promised to do just that

-------
Us men must speak up and speak out loudly to protect Roe v. Wade and access to abortion.  #DemDebate
-------
Klobuchar would codify Roe v. Wade. And funding Planned Parenthood. Good idea. Reproductive Justice/Rights is Disability Justice/Rights  #DemocraticDebate #DemDebates #CripTheVote
-------
‚Äúwe should codify roe v. wade into law.‚Äù

‚Äúroe v. wade is settled law.‚Äù

- same people
-------
Reminder ahead of the #DemDebate: Abortion is a winning issue. 77% of Americans do not want #RoevWade overturned. 62% of voters oppose attempts to ban abortion past 6-8 weeks of pregnancy. 70% oppose laws that would allow abortion providers to be fined or jailed #AskAboutAbortion
