Recent administrations with the LEAST criminal indictments:

Notice a pattern?
-------
No wall No Infrastructure. No beautiful republican health care.  No reduction in drugs. No help for homeless Vets. No improvement in Education. No gun control.  No border reform. Republicans had both houses and WH for 2 years. What the hell did they accomplish?
-------
Biggest political story of the decade is not Trump or impeachment, but GOP’s willingness to destroy the rule of law for political expediency. My grandfather would not recognize his Republican party. It’s like a star that flames bright red just before it dies.
-------
#KremlinKevin #MoscowMitch This is disgusting. They look us in the eye & lie to us. They attack our FBI. It's as if they got TRAINED in Russia BESIDES receiving Russian $$. Are there MANDATORY online KGB courses for Republican legislators that we don't know about?
-------
Every day more damning evidence against the most Criminally Corrupt President in our Nation’s history is revealed. That’s why Moscow Mitch is afraid of a fair trial. If the truth was presented, even the toady Republican Cult might be forced to throw the bum out.
-------
The single biggest mystery in my mind is how does Donald Trump keep ever single Republican in line, protecting all his criminality? Why are they so afraid of him? We see #KingCon behind the curtain, but what strings does he pull? Is there kompromat on the entire party?
-------
To understand our political moment is to understand the Republican Party is riddled with a terminal affliction and is more than willing to undermine every law and institution to ensure it retains power in the face of declining electoral viability.

That’s base level reality.
